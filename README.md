Projects I'm working on! 

### Usage
Let's install some of the theme dependencies before serving up our site.
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full ruby-bundler libffi-dev
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Now we're ready to work on the site. To build and serve it, run:
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

And you're all set! Head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ to see the site in action.
