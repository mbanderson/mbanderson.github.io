Hey, I'm Michael! I'm a robotics engineer who enjoys challenges in state estimation, motion planning, and autonomous systems. My work has been [blown apart][arkyd], [sent into orbit][elfin], [sold to consumers][magic], and [tested on the open road][aptiv].

In 2018 I completed my M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford, where I specialized in robotics and controls. In 2016 I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing from UCLA.

On this site I'll document the projects I'm working on and write down some things I don't want to forget. You can find me on [GitHub][mbanderson-github] and [LinkedIn][mbanderson-linkedin]. Thanks for reading!
