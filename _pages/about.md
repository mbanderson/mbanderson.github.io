Hey, I'm Michael! I'm a robotics engineer who enjoys challenges in state estimation, motion planning, and autonomous systems. My work has been [blown apart](https://www.space.com/27596-planetary-resources-spacecraft-antares-explosion.html), [sent into orbit](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/UCLA-ELFIN-launch), [sold to consumers](https://mashable.com/2017/12/20/magic-leap-mixed-reality-headset-revealed/), and [tested on the open road](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/aptivs-self-driving-bmws-have-made-more-than-50000-rides-on-the-lyft-app-in-las-vegas/).

In 2018 I completed my M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford, where I specialized in robotics and controls. In 2016 I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing from UCLA.

On this site I'll document the projects I'm working on and write down some things I don't want to forget. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbanderson) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbanderson1/). Thanks for reading!
